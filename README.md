# Company Tester
As an assignment of my CS102 course, I implemented a program that sends items between customers. A customer orders items and the company creates a package with those items and 
delivers it. The item is delivered as a mail or package depending on the item weight. When the package is delivered, its delivery information is printed on the screen.
